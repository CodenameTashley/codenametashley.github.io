                <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>

                <p>Hello, I am Tashley Toocaram and an upcoming graduate that was enrolled in a bachelor degree with honours
                    in Applied Computing at the University of Mauritius. I am also a junior software developer at <a href="www.chb-technologies.mu">CHB Technologies Ltd</a>                    where I kick started my professional career as a junior software developer.</p>
                <p>This small web app is about introducing me to the world and was developed as an experiment to apply some
                    of the knowledge acquired during my probation period at <b>CHB Technologies Ltd</b>. My main technical
                    interests are Programming, Networking, Big Data and Cloud Computing. Apart from writing codes, I am also
                    spend time playing football or getting my hands dirty with other programming languages and frameworks.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">My Inspirations</h2>

                <!-- <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a
                    task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill
                    of just beginning.</p>

                <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered
                    prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical
                    process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p> -->

                <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                <!-- <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
                    marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
                    delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change
                    a man.</p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore
                    strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth
                    to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
