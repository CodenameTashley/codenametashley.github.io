                    Hello, I am Tashley Toocaram and an upcoming graduate that was enrolled in a bachelor degree with honours in Applied Computing at the University of Mauritius. I joined the professional world of software development as a Junior Software Developer at <a href="http://www.chb-technologies.mu">CHB Technologies Ltd</a> after my tertiary education.</p>

                    <p>This small web app is about introducing me and it was developed during my free time (after winning too many matches in FIFA). It is also an interface to connect you guys with my different social network accounts.</p>

                    <p>I was introduced in the programming world by <b>Mr. James Leong Mook Seng</b> at the age of 17 and at that time I was writing codes in Pascal. And during my pre-university holidays, I developed small programs using pascal.
                    <br/></p>

                    <p>
                        Then I joined the <a href="http://www.uom.ac.mu">University of Mauritius</a> in August 2014 to pursue my studies in the Computing world. There, I was introduced to my all-time favorite programming language, <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> and also other languages like PHP, JavaScript, etc.
                        <br/>
                        Apart from the programming languages that was taught at the University, I also learned basic C#, Python, C++ and Kotlin.
                    </p>

                    <p>In June 2015, I was in the second batch of the <b>Smart Apps Internship</b> Programme organised by Microsoft Student Partners (Mauritius), HM Rawat, Ceridian and Emtel. During the 6 weeks of the programme, we were given the task to create a Windows Phone App. </p>

                    <p>I started my 8 months traineeship at <a href="http://www.infomil.mu">Infomil Mauritius Ltd</a> under its annual programme named <b>Programme d'encadrement</b> that has the aim to provide Level 2 students of universities, the opportunity to work on a project under a professional environment. It was indeed an enriching experience to be surrounded by IT professionals who shared the maximum of their technical &amp; non-technical skills and career tips with us.</p>

                    <p>Before entering in the final year of my BSc programme, along with a classmate, we worked on a project entitled <b>>A Web Based Audio Learning System using Drupal</b>. The duration of this small project was also for 6 weeks.</p>

                <!-- <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a
                    task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill
                    of just beginning.</p>

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical

                <!-- <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
                    marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
                    delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change
                    a man.</p>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore
                    strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth
                    to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
